2016.09.26 - Nice work Victor. You were one of only a few people to write
nested loops in your solution in HW2, which was a very good idea! Check out
the correction to see where you made a slight error. Additionally, the hw's
are simply graded on a submission basis, so even if you don't have time to
do it, you should submit something to get the full grade! That being said, your
participation in class is great and you're doing well. Keep up the good work!

2016.10.03 - HW4 - Good work Victor, but I get the impression you were pressed
for time this week. I understand you all are busy, but do set aside some time
for programming, as it will payoff in the long run!
